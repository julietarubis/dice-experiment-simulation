# dice-experiment-simulation
This repository contains Python code to simulate the experiment of rolling two fair 6-sided dice. The goal is to determine the probability that the sum of the two dice is less than 3 or more than 10.
This repository contains Python code to simulate the experiment of rolling two fair 6-sided dice. The goal is to determine the probability that the sum of the two dice is less than 3 or more than 10. The random variable used in this experiment is discrete, representing the sum of the two dice. The probability distribution is uniform since each outcome has an equal chance of occurring.

The notebook is structured as follows:
- Markdown cell with problem description
- Markdown cells with expected value and standard deviation of the random variable
- Cell(s) with the experiment
- Cell(s) with outputs and graphs
- Commentary comparing calculated values to experimentally obtained values.

The code utilizes the Random, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Math modules to run a sufficient number of experiments, approximate the expected value and standard deviation, and visualize the distribution with an appropriate number of bins.
